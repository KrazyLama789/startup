Start up for BYU CS 260

## Elevator pitch
Have you ever tried to schedule a time to meet up with multiple friends or colleagues, only to run into the logistical nightmare of trying to find when everyone's schedules line up? Have you ever found yourself playing a verbal guessing game that sounds like, "Are you free next Tuesday? How about after 7 pm, three Wednesdays from now? No?" Many adults find it incredibly difficult to keep and maintain healthy friendships because people have infinitely complex lives and schedules. "Meet-Up" is a group calendaring platform where people can join a group, block out times they aren't available, and even highlight times when they would prefer to "Meet-Up", allowing everyone in the group to visually see when their schedules align.
